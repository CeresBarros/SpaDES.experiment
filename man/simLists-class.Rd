\title{The \code{simLists} class}
\description{
This is a grouping of \code{simList} objects
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{paths}}{Named list of \code{modulePath}, \code{inputPath},
and \code{outputPath} paths. Partial matching is performed. These
will be prepended to the relative paths of each \code{simList}}

\item{\code{.xData}}{Environment holding the \code{simLists}.}
}}

\note{
The \code{simList} class extends the \code{environment}, by adding
several slots that provide information about the metadata for a discrete
event simulation. The environment slot, if accessed directly is \code{.xData}
and this is where input and output objects from modules are placed.
The \code{\link{simList_}} class is similar, but it extends the \code{list}
class. All other slots are the same.
Thus, \code{simList} is identical to \code{simList_}, except that the former
uses an environment for objects and the latter uses a list.
The class \code{simList_} is only used internally.
